# Flighty

Flighty is introduced as the css framework behind [Thinkful](https://thinkful.me).

## Motivation

Bootstrap is the goto css framework for building MVPs. However, it is very
large and requires much overhead. Flighty is a very small library with less
emphasis on extreme portability. However, Flighty shares the goal with
Bootstrap that we can provide good-looking defaults without an immediate
need for custom css.

## Usage

Flighty is not for everyone. Flighty is minimalist and (hopefully) beautiful.
Flighty is just as experimental as Thinkful is - and this is fun. So if you
want to play around with interesting css and contribute to simple elegance,
Flighty may be a library to look at.

## Documentation

Right now, the best source of documentation is the [Thinkful](https://thinkful.me)
app itself. The html is simple and should be easy to follow. Until the point
when someone has time to write down some documentation, Thinkful is the best
place to look.
