# Flighty

Flighty is the CSS framework behind [Thinkful](https://thinkful.me).

## Motivation

Bootstrap is the goto CSS framework for building MVPs. However, it is very
large and requires much overhead. Flighty is a very small library with less
emphasis on extreme portability and design choices. Instead, Flighty provides
more structural code with the intent that the end-user can style and perfect
the design. Fundamentally, Flighty just provides a structural boilerplate
for apps.

## Usage

Flighty is not for everyone. Flighty is minimalist and addresses structure.
Furthermore, Flighty is just as experimental as Thinkful is - and
this is fun. So if you want to play around with interesting css and
contribute to simple elegance, Flighty may be a library to look at.

If you are looking for a complete and ready-to-go-framework that makes
design (as in artistic) decisions for you, look elsewhere!

As an actual usage note, Thinkful uses Flighty in conjunction with Modernizr.

## Documentation

Right now, the best source of documentation is the [Thinkful](https://thinkful.me)
app itself. The html is simple and should be easy to follow. Until the point
when someone has time to write down some documentation, Thinkful is the best
place to look.

However, there is an example form available as well:

## Example

See [here](http://cssdeck.com/labs/ayn3qvhy) for an example form built
with Flighty.

## Looks Good!

Thanks! Feel free to contribute in the spirit. Tons of classes are missing
as you may have noticed. Not much more than was needed for Thinkful has
been provided.

Also, I'm looking for freelance work right now. So if you're interested,
