# Flighty

Flighty is the css framework behind [Thinkful](https://thinkful.me).

## Motivation

Bootstrap is the goto css framework for building MVPs. However, it is very
large and requires much overhead. Flighty is a very small library with less
emphasis on extreme portability. However, Flighty shares the goal with
Bootstrap - provide good-looking defaults without an immediate
need for custom css.

## Usage

Flighty is not for everyone. Flighty is minimalist and (hopefully)
beautiful. Furthermoe, Flighty is just as experimental as Thinkful is - and
this is fun. So if you want to play around with interesting css and
contribute to simple elegance, Flighty may be a library to look at.

Thinkful uses Flighty in conjunction with Modernizr.

## Documentation

Right now, the best source of documentation is the [Thinkful](https://thinkful.me)
app itself. The html is simple and should be easy to follow. Until the point
when someone has time to write down some documentation, Thinkful is the best
place to look.

## Reactions

### Looks Good!

Thanks! I'm looking for freelance work right now. I'd like to start immediately. Email me at the address in my profile.

### Stop Rewriting Everything!

I hear you. This is just a fun little library to keep myself busy. That
doesn't necessarily mean it's not interesting!
