# Flighty

Flighty is the CSS framework behind [Shopful](https://shopful.me) and
[ThinkfulMe](https://thinkful.me).

## Motivation

Bootstrap is the goto CSS framework for building MVPs. However, it is very
large and requires much overhead. Flighty is a very small library with less
emphasis on extreme portability and design choices. Instead, Flighty provides
more structural code with the intent that the end-user can style and perfect
the design. Fundamentally, Flighty provides a structural boilerplate
for apps.

## Philosophy

Flighty is not for everyone. Flighty is minimalist and addresses structure.
Classes and structure is added on an as-needed basis. So if you want to play
around with interesting css and contribute to simple elegance, Flighty may
be a library to look at.

If you are looking for a complete and ready-to-go-framework that makes
design (as in artistic) decisions for you, look elsewhere!

## Documentation

Right now, the best source of documentation is the [Shopful](https://shopful.me)
app itself or in some standalone jsfiddle-esque pages. The html is simple and
should be easy to follow. Until the point when someone has time to write down
some documentation, Shopful is the best place to look.

## Looks Good!

Thanks! Feel free to contribute in the spirit. Tons of classes are missing
as you may have noticed. Not much more than was needed for Shopful, ThinkfulMe has
been provided.

I'm always looking for contract work. So if you're interested,
email me at the address in my profile.
